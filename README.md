👋 Hi there! I’m  @1stlazyCoder,a Computer Engineering student and a passionate self-learner, currently 20 and exploring diverse tech skills to build a bright, halal future.

💡 What I do:

📹 Video Editing (YouTube & Social Media Content)

✍️ Content & Blog Writing

💻 Intermediate Python & C++ Development

🌐 Web Development & Shopify Store Design

🎮 When I’m not coding or editing videos, you’ll find me gaming or reading deep psychological quotes — always seeking ideas that inspire and challenge me.

🚀 Goals:
I’m on a mission to build, learn, and grow through honest, halal business opportunities. Every project I create is a step towards sustainable and ethical income, and I’m open to collaboration, feedback, and new ideas.
